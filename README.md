# Task D: Questions

### How long did this assignment take you and where did you spend your time?

This assessment took me about 4 hours to complete. I spent most of my time on Task A, implementing the UI designs. The functionality on Task B and C did not take much of my time

### What would you do differently or improve in your solution?

Aligning icons was a bit difficult.  I should have aligned them properly. 

### Do you have any feedback on this assignment? For example: What did you enjoy? What could be better? Which aspects were unclear?

I think I can do better with regards to responsiveness. Overall I reaaly enjoyed doing this assessment because React is one of my favorite JavaScript libraries.
